# RISC-V crates

This repository contains various crates useful for writing Rust programs on RISC-V microcontrollers:

* [`riscv`]: CPU registers access and intrinsics
* [`riscv-pac`]: Common traits to be implemented by RISC-V PACs
* [`riscv-peripheral`]: Interfaces for standard RISC-V peripherals
* [`riscv-rt`]: Startup code and interrupt handling
* [`riscv-semihosting`]: Semihosting for RISC-V processors

This project is developed and maintained by the [RISC-V team][team].
